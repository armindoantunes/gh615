= command line only =

At the current time, this utility is command line only, meaning there is no Graphical User Interface. That should not keep you from trying it out, as the command line is very intuitive for the basic operations supported.

A GUI might or might not happen in the future.

= Usage =

Double click `gh615_console.exe` and follow the instructions

== Working with Waypoints ==
The waypoint implementation is still kind of sketchy at the moment.

Currently this is the way to do it:

  # Download trackpoints (option `d`); waypoints.txt will be created in the root.
  # Edit waypoints.txt; if you change the title a new waypoint will be created instead of updating the exisiting
  # Upload trackpoints (option `e`)

=== structure of waypoints.txt ===
waypoints.txt is a simple dump of a python 'list'-data structure, which looks like this:

{{{
[
{'latitude': '48.052148', 'longitude': '8.210360', 'altitude': 583, 'type': 55, 'title': 'waypo1'},
{'latitude': '50.052148', 'longitude': '5.210360', 'altitude': 883, 'type': 54, 'title': 'waypo2'}
]
}}}

==== fields ====
most fields are self explanatory, just note that the `title` does not exceed 6 characters. `type` assigns the icon that is display on the map of the gh615.
